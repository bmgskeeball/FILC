      <h2>Understanding Rankings</h2>
      <p>FILC does not publish a global player leaderboard. Instead, we maintain a dynamic analytics system used to rank players within sanctioned tours and national circuits, with a focus on performance, scoring consistency, and competitive tier.</p>

      <h3>Scoring Standards</h3>
      <p>Arcade Rolling matches are scored out of 900 per frame. Matches are typically 10 frames, with the lowest score droppedâ€”making the max possible match score 8100 (displayed as "810").</p>
      <p>Scores are often written without the trailing zero (e.g., a 540 frame is notated as "54") for clarity in competition summaries. Tournament scorecards always use the full value.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Performance Tiers</h3>
      <p>Elite competitors (Premier Division) average 500â€“600 per frame (50â€“60). Most competitive players score in the 300â€“450 range. Scores above 700 are exceptionally rare.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Premier Division:</strong> Top 100 players internationally</li>
        <li><strong>Challenger Division:</strong> Ranked 101â€“250 globally</li>
        <li><strong>Developmental Division:</strong> All other ranked professionals</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Simpson Points & Ranking Calculations</h3>
      <p>The world ranking system is based on Simpson Points, awarded based on event tier and finishing position. Points are calculated from a player's best 12 events over a rolling 24-month period. Grand Prix and Major events are weighted more heavily than Challenger events.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Major Championships:</strong> 150â€“200% weight</li>
        <li><strong>Grand Prix Events:</strong> 100â€“125%</li>
        <li><strong>Challenger Events:</strong> 50â€“75%</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Bonus Simpson Points are awarded for Perfect Frames, Diamond Rings (5 consecutive 800+ games), and tournament-high frame scores.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Rollmaster Designation</h3>
      <p>The title of <strong>Rollmaster</strong> is awarded to players who:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Win a FILC Major Championship</li>
        <li>Achieve a Perfect Frame (900 points)</li>
        <li>Win three or more Grand Prix events</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This honor is permanent and does not expire. Each country maintains its own list of national Rollmasters. Some regional circuits or rival associations also maintain Rollmaster titles, resulting in occasional overlap or contention.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Analytics and Metrics</h3>
      <p>FILC publishes limited advanced stats, but many federations and fans use deeper metrics to evaluate player performance:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frame Average (FA):</strong> Mean score across all official frames</li>
        <li><strong>Peak Frame:</strong> Highest single frame in competition</li>
        <li><strong>Zero Rate:</strong> Percentage of rolls scoring zero (Zilch)</li>
        <li><strong>Strike Rate:</strong> Frequency of foot faults or illegal deliveries</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency Index:</strong> Standard deviation of frame scores across a match or season</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Advanced analytics platforms like <em>Savant.Roll</em> and <em>FrameLab</em> provide tools for deeper match analysis, including opponent-adjusted scores and lane condition factors.</p>
