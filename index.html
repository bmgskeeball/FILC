      <h3>What is Arcade Rolling?</h3>
      <p>Arcade Rolling is the evolved, regulated form of a classic arcade game. While often referred to as skeeball in the United States, the competitive sport is distinct in both rules and regulation. Played on certified lanes with league-grade equipment, it has grown into a ranked international sport with formal titles, seasonal tours, and a dedicated governing body.</p>

        <li><strong>Spin Bowling</strong> in parts of Central Europe</li>
        <li><strong>Boardwalk Rolling</strong> in the United States</li>

      <h3>Rollmasters & Rankings</h3>
      <p>The highest honor in the sport is Rollmaster status, awarded for major championship wins, perfect frames, or elite multi-season performance. While FILC governs the global Rollmaster list, many national and regional circuits maintain their own rankings, sometimes leading to multiple competing designations.</p>
