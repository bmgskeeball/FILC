      <h2>About FILC</h2>
      <p><strong>Fédération Internationale de Lancer Ciblé (FILC)</strong> is the international governing body for the sport of <strong>Arcade Rolling</strong>, also known as <em>Seven-Ring Bowling</em>. Established to preserve and promote the sport beyond its trademarked origins, FILC formalizes competition, standardizes global rules, and fosters a growing network of national federations.</p>

    <section class="history">
      <h3>History & Origins</h3>
      <p>Arcade Rolling traces its lineage back to the invention of Skee-Ball in New Jersey in 1908 by <strong>Joseph Fourestier Simpson</strong>, a Philadelphia-born inventor. While the commercial version of the game grew popular on American boardwalks, a lesser-known postwar version took hold in Europe after World War II.</p>
      <p>According to federation records, an American soldier named J. Oscar Watkins stationed in Germany brought shortened alley lanes to military bases as a morale activity. Over time, these makeshift setups evolved into permanent lanes across amusement parks in Helsinki, Copenhagen, and beyond.</p>
