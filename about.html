      <h3>Our Organization</h3>
      <p><strong>F√©d√©ration Internationale de Lancer Cibl√© (FILC)</strong> is the international governing body for the sport of <strong>Arcade Rolling</strong>, also known as <em>Seven-Ring Bowling</em>. Sometimes referred to in the United States as the arcade game "skeeball," the sport is independently governed worldwide by FILC.</p>
      <p>Our goal is to foster international competition and support the long-term growth of the game through activities, rankings, and tournaments. With member federations spanning 78 countries across six continents, FILC has established a global footprint for what began as a simple amusement game.</p>

    <section class="history">
      <h3>History & Origins</h3>
      <p>Arcade Rolling traces its lineage back to the invention of Skee-Ball in New Jersey in 1908 by <strong>Joseph Fourestier Simpson</strong>, a Philadelphia-born inventor. While the commercial version of the game grew popular on American boardwalks, a lesser-known postwar version took hold in Europe after World War II.</p>
      <p>According to federation records, a Black American soldier stationed in Germany brought shortened alley lanes to military bases as a morale activity. Over time, these makeshift setups evolved into permanent lanes across amusement parks in Helsinki, Copenhagen, and beyond.</p>
      <p>The first international competition was held in 1923, leading to the formation of FILC later that year. Initially, lanes were as long as 35 feet with only 5 rings before the standardization of the 7-ring variant in the 1950s. The iconic "Simpson Corner Pockets" were introduced during this period and became standardized by the 1970s as an internationally recognized feature.</p>
